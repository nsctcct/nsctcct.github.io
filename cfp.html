       <b> The 8th Symposium of Nonlinear Systems and Control is scheduled to be held from October 17th to 20th, 2024, in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, China </b> . Sponsored by North University of China and the Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation, and co-sponsored by Shanxi University, Taiyuan University of Technology, Shaanxi Normal University, this symposium aims to provide a broad academic exchange platform for domestic and international scholars and relevant engineering and technical personnel in the field of nonlinear systems and control, showcasing the latest theoretical and technological achievements. The theme of this year's symposium will focus on the new developments in the field of nonlinear systems and control research. The symposium will include plenary sessions, keynote speeches, invited sessions, and poster sessions for communication. Submission types include full papers and extended abstracts, which can be in Chinese or English. Some excellent papers will be recommended for publication in special issues of journals such as <i>Control Theory & Applications</i>.

        Taiyuan, abbreviated as "Bing", was known as Jinyang in ancient times and is also referred to as Bingzhou and Dragon City. With a history of over 2500 years, it boasts the reputation of being the key strategic point in the four passes and the political and economic center controlling the five plains. Taiyuan, characterized by a warm temperate continental monsoon climate, experiences short and windy spring and autumn seasons. Surrounded by mountains on three sides, it is traversed by the Fen River, the second largest tributary of the Yellow River, flowing from north to south. Renowned as the "Exquisite City of Taiyuan" since ancient times, it is an ideal city to host the 8th International Conference on Nonlinear Systems and Control.
